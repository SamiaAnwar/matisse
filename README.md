# matisse
**matisse** is a JavaScript library for performing colour manipulations with support for CSS color strings. Mutable colour entities allow for implicit conversion between RGB, HSV, HSL, CMYK, and HWB colour spaces. Mixing, toning, tinting, shading, and blending operations are also supported including a variety of different blend modes. matisse contains functionality for performing colour measurements as well as functionality for validating and correcting colours to comply with the WCAG standards for contrast. In addition, this library allows for palette generation for different colour harmonies according to colour theory principles.

This project was originally developed as a team project for McMaster University's SFWRENG 3XA3: Software Project Management course in collaboration with [Isra Zahid](https://github.com/israzahid) and [Samia Anwar](https://github.com/SamiaAnwar).
